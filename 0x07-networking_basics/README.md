## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Clone the repository to your machine.
Files ``4-TCP_and_UDP_ports`` and  ``5-is_the_host_on_the_network`` are executable.

To display listening ports on your local machine withe the PID and name of program running it:

```
 ./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports
```

To Ping an IP address run:
    ``Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}``
```
./5-is_the_host_on_the_network 8.8.8.8
```
